## Introduction

This report serves as an extension to the shiny app. The primary goal of this project was to create an app that is capable of doing interactive analysis that creates simple but aesthetic visualizations for business management in Australia as part of the second prompt for Datathon 2020. This project was conducted in R. 

## Motivation

As this was my first hackathon that I participated in, I wanted to venture and be more creative with my approach. As such, I thought the idea of an app challenges me and ties in nicely with what I have in mind - interactive app that supports business management in their decision-making. In the current business climate, companies have been revolutionizing their strategies in order to gain competitive edge over their close competitors to generate higher financial returns. In fact, more companies are transiting their operations towards a data-driven structure in order to garner more insights from big data. There are three tasks that interests me in the ideation of the project: Trends by transactions, Trends by time periods and Trends by categories. 

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the organizing committee for providing this valuable opportunity to kickstart my hackathon experience in this domain. I genuinely appreciate the efforts that you guys have done in coordinating the event and the workshops.

I would also like to thank the judges for taking their busy time down to be involved in Datathon 2020 and providing us with valuable insights.
